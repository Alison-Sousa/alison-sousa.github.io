Welcome to my website! I hold a [Bachelor's degree in International Relations](https://www.espm.br/) from the Escola Superior de Propaganda e Marketing (ESPM) in São Paulo. During my studies, I participated in international programs at [Zuyd Hogeschool](https://www.zuyd.nl/) in Maastricht and [Meiji University](https://www.meiji.ac.jp/cip/english/) in Japan. I also completed advanced courses in [Econometrics, Statistics, Mathematics, and Finance](https://www.caf.com/en/) through the Development Bank of Latin America.  

My academic journey has been marked by several awards and recognitions, including achievements in the [CFA Research Challenge](awards/awards.html), the Quant Itaú Asset Challenge, and initiatives by Turim Investimentos and Sigalei. Prior to university, I earned a merit-based scholarship at Grupo CPV Educacional and a merit scholarship through ENEM at ESPM.  

Born and raised in São Paulo, I enjoy traveling, and one of my most memorable trips involved volunteering in underserved communities through lessons and cultural activities. In my free time, I like to play tennis, follow Brazilian football, and explore hobbies like gardening and ebikes. I am also a fan of fall and enjoy immersing myself in nature.
